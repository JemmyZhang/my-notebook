Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist and inventor. He was the former CEO of Stark Industries, a conglomerate originally started by his father, Howard Stark. While in Afghanistan, Tony was captured by Ten Rings, and was ordered to build the Jericho missile for them. Instead, he, along with Ho Yinsen, used their resources to build a suit of armor and make their escape. Returning to America, Tony improves his armor and becomes the armored superhero known as Iron Man.

Tony was still human, with the exception of an Arc Reactor in his chest. However, by the end of Iron Man 3, he has the shrapnel removed, no longer needing the arc reactor. Before the start of Avengers: Infinity War, Tony created a new arc reactor that let him transform into Iron Man. He was one of the richest, smartest and most powerful men on Earth. However, his power comes from his high-tech battle suit known as the Iron Man armor, which grants him extraordinary strength, durability, flight capabilities, and various on-board weaponry. He is a founding member of the Avengers.

In order to stop Thanos once and for all, Tony sacrificed himself to use the Infinity Stones to disintegrate the Mad Titan and his army.
